The story we are about to tell you is true. No matter how unreal it may seem, we need your help. The 
following all happened over the last year.<br><br>
Here is how it all began...<br><br>
About a year ago, we had a flood which damaged the bottom portion of our house extensively. Little did 
we know that opening some sheet rock and wall, would open up something much darker.<br><br>
We came across some surprises after the work began. There was the normal dust, and debris. At first it 
all seemed fairly normal, albeit annoying. But things slowly took a dark turn no one expected! At first it 
was small things. A bump here, a clank there. We started to realize something was running afoul, when 
the sounds would persist through the evening without any work being done! At first it was a loud thud. 
We chalked it up to a roommate moving or dropping something. One day though, when everyone had 
gathered downstairs for dinner, we heard it, and LOUD! It was not just a crushing sound, it was tearing, 
gnashing, something primal. We looked around at each other in disbelief, when we realized everyone 
was downstairs in the same room, and we all heard it. We rushed upstairs to see what it could have 
been. Nothing, nothing out of place, nothing wrong. At first it was just sounds. Then it became more. 
Construction workers asking who broke their tools, dishes broken in the middle of the floor, walls that 
had been fixed, were broken again. The more we tried to blame it on the construction, the quicker it 
became clear, something else was going on.<br><br>
The final straw came with the bodies. As they were examining yet another unexplained break in an air 
duct below our house, they came across it. A white, long, solid seeming “thing” erupting from the dark, 
murky, earth below our home. It was as if it was calling out to no longer remain buried. We heard the 
scream. Not a high pitch, nor panicked, but raw deep and harrowing. The AC tech came from below our 
home, whiter than the protective suit he wore to go below. He told us, we called the police, who called 
a specialist, who brought in teams of experts to remove it. They took soil samples, they said there was 
no threat of bacteria or other harm. But they did not mention the threats that can come from something 
other than human.<br><br>
Roommates left at that point. That was enough for them to never want to be in the house again, 
something compelled us to remain. One of those feelings you cannot explain, but Norina and I both 
shared this desire to see this through to the end.<br><br>
It was not until we heard the comments that we realized something more may have been awakened 
in these walls, under this very home! The officer, a long time veteran with the force, made a passing 
comment while speaking to his fellow officers in front of the home after the brutal find. “Again? This 
place, what is it with this place? I thought those nuts were all gone or dead at this point.” It was not 
until another week had passed that I saw the officer again. They ended up finding over 20 bodies down 
there. When he came back about a week later I approached him and asked “You said something last 
time you were here, something about again, and people being dead. What was that about”?<br><br>
He told me the story. This is the third time they had come to the house to deal with the ending of 
human life. When this house was first built, a cult had practiced their dark arts in this very house. It 
was a different time, the mid 70s. Cults sprung up overnight worshiping and striving to achieve what no 
mortal should. This “Cult of the unbound flesh” was particularly brutal. By mastering, and mutilating the 
“flesh that limited all mankind” they aimed to go beyond what normal human beings could. <br><br>
I could see the officers face becoming more and more disturbed, as he recounted details of the bodies 
they found here. It was not until the death of a beautiful young woman that the police took is seriously. 
She was the daughter of an affluent family. It filled the papers. It could not be ignored. It was not 
until a $10,000 reward that someone came through with a lead, which finally led to her body, and the 
discovery of a cult hiding in the shadows. After much digging, they found them all one by one.
He told me they had their own unholy books. Their dark rights. Madness he said. One by one the cult 
members took their own lives, rather than reveal the secrets they hid. They were either dead by the 
time police came to their home, or within a day of landing in jail. Then the madness ended. For 20 
years, no more deaths. The police work was championed. The chief received awards, and all the officers 
involved received commendations. And the world moved on. The house was torn down, and a new one 
build over it. The entire thing just... disappeared.<br><br>
I was stunned by this story. What horrors lay right below my feet. He had more to tell.<br>
“20 years went by. Sure I saw death, but the normal stuff an officer does. Nothing like that. Not until 
the 90s. Here, again. There was a man living here. Lawyer, rich guy. Worked with some big name law 
firm. They found him and his whole family. Brains smeared all over the place. Everyone murdered. Dark 
stuff, stuff you don't want to see. But then I saw what really bothered me. The damn cult symbols! All 
over again!I They were etched into my mind 20 years ago to the day on November first. Last time we 
found them all here. The cult people. They had these weird symbols, images, painted all over, tattooed 
on, carved in their skin. They guy had painted the symbols all over. All around his wife and his kid. 
Weird vials, tubes ‘n beakers. Jars with god knows what in them. A fridge filled with “parts.”. All this lab 
equipment. Nothing like I ever seen before.<br><br>
I warned the chief it was happening again. But no one would listen. Why would they want the crowning 
achievement of their carriers sullied. They blamed it on an isolated incident. Lawyer just went nuts they 
said. Lost it, took him and his family with him. He probably found out what happened here before and it 
was too much. He snapped. That was that, no investigation. But I kept something, something important. 
A small book. One like the old cult members had.<br><br>
It was full of the symbols. And all this talk of “the rise of the human monsters”, of being closer and 
closer, to the final goal of the unbound flesh. I read it all and terror just filled me up inside. All of this 
was to make some dark potion, their “blessed leader” promised would make human beasts. Let them 
render the weak human flesh, and become something more. In the book it talked about the “others” 
dying for the cause. How the past cult members were martyrs for the “great undertaking. According to 
the book, this whole “Unbound Flesh” thing was a mixture of science, alchemy and old dark magic. To 
go beyond what any normal human could do, to create human beasts. Monsters capable of feats that 
no being of mortal flesh could perform. To go past the mortal coil, to master death, to go to the darkest 
reaches of the human soul, and comeback something much more powerful and sinister than mortal 
man.”<br><br>
At this point I was pale... probably white as a ghost. I asked him “what happened to the book?”<br>
He told me:<br>
“I took it in to evidence. Told the chief we had to look into this. This was not some joke. Told him what 
they were trying to do. Human monsters. Creature twisted by magic and science. And that was the end 
of it.”<br>
“What do you mean?” I asked hurriedly.<br>
“Well, they lost it. Lost it my ass... They wanted it gone. I checked for it and then the whole box went 
missing. All of it. The tubes, the samples, the book. All gone. The photos, all the pictures we took of 
the scene. None of the cops wanted to dig up the mess again. No one wanted to lose their medals and 
awards for bringing the cult down. I asked the chief, what was going to happen. I expected heads to roll 
in a case like this. But he said to shut it. I tried to convince him to look into it, but he never did. That was 
that. Chief didn't want to be caught up in the whole mess either I guess...”
I looked at him, I could see the anger still on his face. “That's it? Didn't you try to do something? I mean, 
c’mon. There had to be something you could do.”<br><br>
He looked at me seriously, “That is it.” Then he got this weird look in his eye. I could see the fury ease. 
He got quiet, came close and said in a whisper, “Look I found something else... These papers.” I could 
feel my heart clinch in my chest. I knew this was going to be something important. “They don't make 
any sense. I tried for months to figure them out. It was from this folder called “the end of the flesh” It 
was like a puzzle. I... I got a copy I can share with you. I hadn't turned this in yet, especially once I heard 
about everything going missing. I started to solve some of it, but... you’re part of this too.”
Told me he had figured some of it out, but not all of it. There was this madness, this panic and urgency 
to his voice. To be honest, it frightened me “I am going to drop these off with you, do what you can. I 
would try and get some help if I were you. 20 years and I can’t solve it. He trailed off. “There is this stuff 
in these papers... Says it will keep coming back once every score.”
Another officer came over to talk to him. He immediately became quiet, so I just walked off. Before he 
left our house, he came over to talk with me once more.<br><br>
“Look good luck with this. I... There is something going on here. Be careful. I know it sounds crazy, I am 
a cop, I shouldn't.... there is no other way, who will listen... I mean I tried... It is not your job, but you get 
it, I can tell you do, you seen it, you heard things too... you understand, you do right? Just, be safe. You 
and your girl, take care. Just, be safe.” Then he walked away.<br><br>
Was he crazy? That was the last I ever saw of him. Next time the cops came by it was someone else. I 
asked what happened to the old guy. Turns out he blew his brains out. Weird symbols all around him 
where he did it. <br><br>
Then the sergeant in charge came by and gave me the news. Most of the bodies were 40 years old, 
going back to the 70s and the old cult. But there were bodies later, bodies from the 90s, probably from 
the crazy lawyer. Made sense I guess. Then the part that scared me... Bodies from a few years ago! Just 
shortly before we moved in... Something was still going on here. He said they were all at least a few 
years old. They had all the samples they thought they would need at this point. Said they would let me 
know, if they had to get back under the house or anything else.<br><br>
A big manila envelope came for me in the mail, from the officer who just killed himself. They were the 
papers he was telling me he would share. Inside of it, I think, are the clues to stopping all this. The cult, 
the killing and the haunting of our home. The fear, the insanity, all of it. And I need your help to make it 
happen! That is why you are all invited here...<br><br>
We tried to leave... tried to hope it would all go away... But something happened. People, well, things 
are following us. It is not just this house anymore. This is big, and we cannot do it alone! I will tell you 
all about it when you get here... But it has to happen, and on this day. Friends, family, help us end this 
nightmare once and for all! For all humanity’s sake!</td>
